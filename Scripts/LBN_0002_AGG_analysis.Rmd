# Set up
Set-up the notebook. This script loads the environment, and contains the names for the data file, and sources the additional scripts that will be used for the analysis.
```{r GetReady}
source("./Scripts/LBN_0002_AGG_setUp.R")
dateToday = Sys.Date()
filterDateForTaskDFs = as.Date("2020-12-01") #Look for breed dates/DOBs after this date
```

# Load Data
The "load_LBN_data" function takes the data folder and excel file name and outputs a list with the processed dataframes. These have the demographic data and any "mutations" (calculated columns) added already.
The output of this chunk is each of these dataframes.
```{r LoadData, include=FALSE}

  dataFolder = DataFolder,
  excelName = LBN_DataName
)

# Dam and Litter Tasks
This chunk runs the functions that create the dates dataframes for the dams and offsprings. This uses information about breed dates, plug dates, and dates of birth, along with other demographic information, to indicate when different tasks need to be completed for each animal.

## Write the dates dataframes to an excel file
This chunk creates a workbook and writes the Dam_dates and Off_dates dataframes to separate sheets. It also adds conditional formating that highlights when tasks should be completed relative to today's date.
```{r to Excel-File, include=FALSE}
datesWB <- createWorkbook()

                Dam_dates[order(Dam_dates$DOB, Dam_dates$Breed_date),], #sort by DOB and then Breed_date
                datesWB, 
                tableStyle = "TableStyleLight8")
writeToWorkbook("Offspring Dates", 
                Off_dates[order(Off_dates$DOB),],

# Summarize Mass Values
This uses the "LBN_summary_byGroup" function to calculate the mean, SD, n, and SEM for each of the massDates. It groups the data by Treatment and Strain. This output could be saved to a dataframe, and ultimately output as an excel file using openxlsx.
This same function could be used to summarize other variables
```{r echo=FALSE}
#Summarize the mass values by treatment and strain
map_dfr(massDates, LBN_summary_byGroup, Mass_off, exprs(Treatment, Strain))
```

# Mass plots
This chunck reshapes the mass dataframe so that each day is a different row, and then uses the gather function to plot these with a line plot. The line plot can show individual lines with reduced density (more transparent) (individualLines = TRUE) and to plot the mean for each group (meanLines = TRUE)
```{r echo=FALSE}
Mass_off_long <- reshapeForMassPlot(Mass_off)

Mass_off_long

mass_plot_lines(Mass_off_long,
                individualLines = TRUE,
                mean_lines = TRUE)
```

This chunk summarizes the data first by litter and then plots the mass data. The "getAvgByDam" function can be used with other dataframes. Adding the "line_group" option within the "mass_plots_lines" allows you to specify that the lines should be grouped by Dam_ID instead of by Mouse_ID.
```{r}
#summarized by Litter

Mass_off %>%
  groupByDam()%>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric, list(~mean(., na.rm = TRUE), ~sd(., na.rm = TRUE)))

Mass_off_byDam <- getAvgByDam(Mass_off)
Mass_off_byDam

Mass_off_byDam_long <- reshapeForMassPlot(Mass_off_byDam)
Mass_off_byDam_long

mass_plot_lines(Mass_off_byDam_long,
                     line_group = expr(Dam_ID))
```

# Pup Loss
This table summarizes the number of pups that were lost during the early-life stress paradigm in the different groups.
```{r Pup Loss, echo=FALSE}
Demo_dam %>%
  filter(!is.na(Treatment)) %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Dam_Strain, ParaType) %>%
  summarize(Mean_pupLoss = mean(pupLoss, na.rm = TRUE),
            n(),
            .groups = "drop")

#Also, keep in mind that one of the LBN cages had to be ended early because dam was not caring for pups, and only one pup was left. But this dam had already lost pups before the start of the paradigm, and only started with three pups
```

# Offspring Maturation
This table summarizes the maturation variables (VO, First Estrus, Preputial Separation) by sex, treatment, and strain.
This could also be added to a workbook and exported to an excel file.
```{r Offspring-maturation, echo=FALSE}
Maturation_summary <- map_dfr(maturationVars, LBN_summary_byGroup, Maturation_off, exprs(Sex, Treatment, Strain))
Maturation_summary
#Could add to a workbook
```

## Cumulative Frequency Plots
This is an example of the cumulative frequency plot for the timing of VO. This shows what percentage of animals have had VO on a given day.
```{r Cumulative-Freq, echo=FALSE}
#Example with VO
my_cumulative_freq_plot(
  df = Maturation_off,
  color_var = expr(Treatment),
  linetype_var = expr(Dam_Strain),
  var_to_plot = expr(VO_age), #as expr()
  phenotype_name = "Vaginal Opening", #string
  title = TRUE,
  change_xmax = FALSE,
  xmax = NA,
  xmin = 21
)
```

## Puberty Dot Plot
This plot, again with the example of VO, plots the day of vaginal opening for each individual mouse and compares between groups.
```{r Puberty-DotPlot, echo=FALSE}
my_puberty_dot_plot(Maturation_off, expr(VO_age), "VO", DaysOrMass = "Days")
```

### t-tests
These are the t-tests the compare the timing of preputial separation, first estrus, and vaginal opening for the different treatment groups.
```{r}
t.test(PreputialSep_age ~ Treatment, Maturation_off)
t.test(Estrus_age ~ Treatment, Maturation_off)
t.test(VO_age ~ Treatment, Maturation_off)
```

# Offspring Estrous Cycles
This plots the cycles for the control animals and LBN animals within two sets of graphs. These use the "facet_wrap" function to plot each individual animal. 
```{r Cycles-Plot, echo=FALSE}

Cycles_off_long <- make_cycles_long(Cycles_off) %>%
  add_Day_col()
Cycles_off_long

#Plot the control animals
Cycles_off_long %>%
  filter(Treatment == "Control") %>%
  cyclesPlotFunc()

#Plot the LBN animals
Cycles_off_long %>%
  filter(Treatment == "LBN") %>%
  cyclesPlotFunc()
```

```{r Acute Stress Plot}
#Use gather to make this a long form table to plot. One column for cort, and another that tells whether it was pre or post
Acute_stress_long_form <- makeCortLong(AcuteStress_off)

Acute_stress_long_form <- Acute_stress_long_form %>%
  filter(Sex == "M")

AcuteStress_off

Acute_stress_plot = stress_interaction_plot(Acute_stress_long_form, Cort, "Cort (ng/mL)")

# Write Dataframes to Workbooks
This chunk creates a dataframe workbook for the LBN data. Each dataframe is written as its own sheet to this file.
Additional dataframes for summary results could be added.
```{r DataFrame-Workbook, include=FALSE}
LBN_df_wb <- createWorkbook()

writeToWorkbook("Demo_dam", Demo_dam, LBN_df_wb)
writeToWorkbook("Demo_off", Demo_off, LBN_df_wb)
writeToWorkbook("Mass_off", Mass_off, LBN_df_wb)
writeToWorkbook("Maturation_off", Maturation_off, LBN_df_wb)
writeToWorkbook("EndPara_off", EndPara_off, LBN_df_wb)
writeToWorkbook("Cycles_off", Cycles_off, LBN_df_wb)
writeToWorkbook("AcuteStress_off", AcuteStress_off, LBN_df_wb)
writeToWorkbook("ChronicStress_off", ChronicStress_off, LBN_df_wb)
writeToWorkbook("LBN_all", LBN_all, LBN_df_wb)
writeToWorkbook("LBN_data", LBN_data, LBN_df_wb)

#Saved in "Save-Workbooks" section
```

# Save Workbooks
This chunck saves the created LBN dataframe workbook and the dates workbooks. These allow the previous files with the same name to be overwritten. The dataframe workbook appends today's date to the file. The datesWB does not
```{r Save-Workbooks, include=FALSE}
saveWorkbook(LBN_df_wb, file.path(DataOutFolder, paste0("LBN_data_", dateToday, ".xlsx")), overwrite = TRUE)
saveWorkbook(datesWB, file.path(OutputFolder, "TaskTracking", "datesWB.xlsx"), overwrite = TRUE)

```

# Save PowerPoints
Images could be added to a powerpoint file that could save the output for easy reference or presentation.
```{r Save-Powerpoints, include=FALSE}
#save the powerpoints
#print(KNDy_PPT, target = file.path(DataOutputFolder, "KNDy Graphs.pptx"))
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
