This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
dam_behavior_filtered <- dam_behavior %>%
  filter(
    Litter_size_startPara >= 5
  )


behaviorOverTime <- dam_behavior_filtered %>%
  behavior_overTime(
    yVar = Num_exits,
    yLab = "# of exits",
    fontSize = 16,
    dotSize = 3
  )
plot <- behaviorOverTime +
  facet_wrap(
    ~litterNum + earlyLifeTrt,
    ncol = 4,
    labeller = labeller(
      litterNum = litterNum_label

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
